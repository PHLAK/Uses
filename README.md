Uses
====

Occasionally I'm asked what tools I use regularly so I've put together this "uses" document to list them out in detail.

Hardware
--------

My primary workhorse is my laptop, a [Framework 13 (AMD)](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd/). I take it with me everywhere and connect it to my dock for a desk setup when I'm at home.
